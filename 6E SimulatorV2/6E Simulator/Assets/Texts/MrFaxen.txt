Hey, I'm Mr.Faxen! I think I'm your new teacher, but I dunno, really.
Anyhows.....I have a huge secret. DON'T. TELL. ANYONE.
It is my true identity......Mr.Fox. It has long been forgotten, but there is a prophecy.
"Deep in a crater, there you will find, the fox that can withstand lava"
At least, keep it in the back of your mind whilst exploring the school.
