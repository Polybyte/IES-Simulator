Hey! I think our english lesson starts soon. There's just one problem...
My computer stopped working! 
Holy cows...what am I supposed to do? Our lesson starts in 10 minutes and we are going to play kahoot!

Huh? You can help me? That's what I want to hear!
Well, come on in and I'll show you the problem!
Okay then...first we'll need a mouse!
