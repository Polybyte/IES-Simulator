Hello there! Welcome to IES Simulator!
Here, you get Apple Awards by helping teachers. See if you can find a teacher that needs help with something!
But remember, there are a few rules to follow. For example, you are not allowed to use your phone.
Right click to take out your phone. Just not inside the school building! 
Have a nice day! Oh, and don't forget - your assesment starts soon!
