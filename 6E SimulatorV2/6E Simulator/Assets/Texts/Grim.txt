Hello! I'm Grim. You're new here, am I right?
So have you heard of Student Launch? It's supposed to open today....
It seems like some sort of catapult that launches you high up. It sounds really scary.
So you'll have to go check it out for yourself! It's right there, right under the F corridor. Shouldn't be too hard to find.
Have a nice day!
