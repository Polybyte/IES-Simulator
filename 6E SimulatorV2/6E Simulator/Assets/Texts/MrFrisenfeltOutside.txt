Hi! It's you again! How are you doing?
Okay....so now that we're outside the school, I can talk freely....
I just gotta say..... This game is SOOO AWESOME!
I can't imagine a group of students could pull this off!
I just so happen to know the developers. I'll tell you a secret.
Go towards the sandy, spikey mountains behind the school.
When you get to the corner of the school building, walk straigh through the wall. YES! THE WALL!
Good luck!
