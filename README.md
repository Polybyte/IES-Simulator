Contact me if you want to contribute! (speedframegames@gmail.com) It was made in unity so you'll have to get that. Unity is free so yay.

Here's a little step by step guide to getting everything set up!

UNITY
First of all, you'll need unity. That's the "game engine" we used to make the game.
1. Go to unity3d.com
2. Create an account
3. Click Get Unity
4. Click Personal
5. Click Download Unity Hub
6. Install Unity Hub
7. Once it's done, click Official Releases
8. Here you'll see a bunch of versions. You need to get the right one! Go to the discord server (https://discord.gg/JaeymhH) and go to #info. There, it should say what unity version you'll need!
9. Find that version in Unity Hub. Now just click download!
10. A nice little menu will pop up. Here, you can choose what to download. You only NEED unity, so the other stuff you can pick and choose what you want to download. It doesn't really matter that much, but rember the more stuff you choose the longer it will take to download! (You can always download extra stuff later)
11. While you wait, you might as well go to the next step and set up GitHub!
12. When the download is finished, Unity is all set to go! :)

GITHUB
You're also gonna need GitHub. We'll use this to sync the project between our computers!
1. Go to GitHub.com (haha syke you're already on it!)
2. Create an account
3. Go to desktop.github.com and download GitHub desktop.
4. Install that!
5. When the installation is complete, go to https://github.com/SpeedFrame/IES-Simulator and click "Clone or Download".
6. Click "Open in desktop" and say yes to any prompts that pop up.
7. Now, GitHub desktop should start cloning the project (you'll see a progress bar!)
8. When that's done, you're pretty much ready to go. BUT! You won't be able to publish your changes scince you aren't a collaborator. Message me on the discord server (Power_Burger) or email (speedframegames@emailcom
