Welcome to IES Eskilstuna! Your locker is in the F corridor. Just go to that entrance there and you'll see it.
It looks like you have an assesment soon, you better go to a surgery and study for it!
Take your time and learn the layout of the school. Also, try to make some friends!
Otherwise, there is a really strange thing in the B corridor. Looks like some sort of portal....
